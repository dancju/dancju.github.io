title: Understanding Automated Market Makers
---

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) represent a fundamental innovation in decentralized finance, enabling trustless trading through mathematical formulas rather than traditional order books. This article provides a mathematical analysis of Uniswap V2, focusing on its implied order book characteristics and options-like properties.

We'll explore three key aspects as follows.

1. The foundational principles of Uniswap V2's constant product formula.
2. A mathematical derivation of implied order book depth, demonstrating how the constant product formula emerges naturally from basic assumptions.
3. An analysis of liquidity provider positions through the lens of options theory, expressing impermanent loss in terms of standard greek letters.

This approach bridges the gap between traditional financial mathematics and DeFi mechanics, offering insights valuable to traders and researchers.

# Core Principles

In a two-asset liquidity pool, Uniswap V2 maintains value equality before and after trades through two fundamental equations

$$pB=Q\,,\tag{1}$$

$$p'\left(B-\int_p^{p'}f(x)\diff x\right)=Q+\int_p^{p'}xf(x)\diff x\,,\tag{2}$$

where

- $B$ and $Q$ are the respective asset balances in the pool;
- $p$ represents the current price of asset $B$ in terms of asset $Q$;
- $p'$ denotes the post-trade price; and
- $f(x)$ represents the implied order book depth.

# Order Book Depth Function: The Derivation

By substituting $(1)$ into $(2)$, we obtain

$$p'\left(B-\int_p^{p'}f(x)\diff x\right)=pB+\int_p^{p'}xf(x)\diff x\,.$$

Through two successive differentiation with respect to $p'$, we arrive at the ODE

$$\frac{f'(p')}{f(p')}=-\frac{3}{2p'}\,.$$

The solution gives us the order book depth function

$$f(x)=\frac{B\sqrt p}{2x^{3/2}}=\frac{\sqrt{BQ}}{2x^{3/2}}\,.$$

# The Constant Product Property: A Natural Consequence

Our derived depth function leads to two crucial relationships

$$\int_p^{p'}f(x)\diff x=-\sqrt{BQ}\left(\frac1{\sqrt{p'}}-\frac1{\sqrt{p}}\right)\,,$$

$$\int_p^{p'}xf(x)\diff x=\sqrt{BQ}\left(\sqrt{p'}-\sqrt{p}\right)\,.$$

These equations, combined with $(1)$, demonstrate the famous constant product property

$$\left(B-\int_p^{p'}f(x)\diff x\right)\left(Q+\int_p^{p'}xf(x)\diff x\right)=BQ\,.$$

# Impermanent Loss: An Options Perspective

The pool's value function at price $x$ is

$$V(x)=2x\left(B-\int_p^{x}f(\omega)\diff\omega\right)=2\sqrt{BQx}\,.$$

This leads to risk metrics

$$\Delta(x)=\frac{\sqrt{BQ}}{x^{1/2}}>0\,,$$

$$\Gamma(x)=-\frac{\sqrt{BQ}}{2x^{3/2}}<0\,,$$

$$\mathcal V(x)=\Theta(x)=0\,.$$

# Conclusion

Our mathematical analysis reveals several key insights about AMM liquidity provision.

1. The "impermanent loss" phenomenon is fundamentally a manifestation of negative gamma exposure. Liquidity providers are essentially gamma sellers who earn trading fees as compensation for this risk.
2. Liquidity tokens can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any moment, making them zero-duration instruments. Their return density follows a Dirac delta function, resulting in zero theta and vega exposures.
3. This property makes liquidity tokens particularly valuable for options portfolio management
   1. They can be used to hedge gamma risk;
   1. They generate income through trading fees;
   1. They accomplish this without introducing additional vega exposure; and
   1. The combination of fee income and manageable risk metrics makes them an attractive component in sophisticated derivatives strategies.

These findings suggest that AMM liquidity provision, when properly understood through the lens of options theory, can be a powerful tool for risk management and yield generation in decentralized finance.
