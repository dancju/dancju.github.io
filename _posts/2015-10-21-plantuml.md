title: Making Software Documents with PlantUML
---

Like many programmers, I always choose markup languages (LaTeX or Markdown) instead of WYSIWYG editing (MS Word) whenever possible. Recently I have been learning software documentation. All the textbooks I found use WYSIWYG editors, mostly MS Visio, for UML diagrams. I refuse to use WYSIWYG for diagrams while using markup languages for the document itself.

Then I found [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com), which might be the only markup language for UML diagrams. It allows me to integrate the whole building procedure into a makefile, including the compiling of UML diagrams with PlantUML and the final document with LaTeX.

The following is an example of a toy document project, where the structure and the makefile are listed. The `.pu` files are the source code of the UML diagrams, which are compiled into PNG, EPS, or PDF graphics. Besides, [`.dot` files of Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) could be used for diagrams other than UML.

<pre>
├ src
│ ├ bar.pu    # source code of UML bar
│ ├ foo.pu    # source code of UML foo
│ └ main.tex  # source code of the document
├ uml
│ ├ <i>bar.png</i>   # builded UML bar
│ └ <i>foo.png</i>   # builded UML foo
├ <i>main.pdf</i>    # builded document
└ makefile
</pre>

```makefile
# makefile

pu=$(notdir $(wildcard src/*.pu))
png=$(patsubst %.pu,%.png,$(pu))

main.pdf: src/main.tex
	pdflatex src/main.tex

uml/%.png: src/%.pu
	plantuml -o uml $^

all: $(addprefix uml/, $(png)) main.pdf

clean:
	rm -f *.toc *.aux *.log *.out

view:
	open main.pdf

.PHONY: all clean view
```
