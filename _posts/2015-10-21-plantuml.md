title: Typesetting software documents with LaTeX and PlantUML
---

Most programmers wouldn't deny that coding is preferable over WYSIWYG editing, no matter it's a webpage or printed matter. When I write a software document, I usually use LaTeX. But when it comes to the diagrams in that document, especially the UML diagrams, I had to use a WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Visio. Finally, I had to make the diagrams in a graphic interface and export the pictures into LaTeX, and that is painful!

Recently I've been tried to make UMLs with [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com), which converts text codes to image files of UML diagrams. That allows me to integrate the whole building procedure into a makefile, including the compiling of UMLs with PlantUML, and the final document with LaTeX.

The following is an example of a toy document project, where the structure and the makefile are listed.

<pre>
├ src
│ ├ bar.pu    # source code of UML bar
│ ├ foo.pu    # source code of UML foo
│ └ main.tex  # source code of the document
├ uml
│ ├ <i>bar.png</i>   # builded UML bar
│ └ <i>foo.png</i>   # builded UML foo
├ <i>main.pdf</i>    # builded document
└ makefile
</pre>

```makefile
# makefile

pu=$(notdir $(wildcard src/*.pu))
png=$(patsubst %.pu,%.png,$(pu))

main.pdf: src/main.tex
	xelatex src/main.tex

uml/%.png: src/%.pu
	plantuml -o uml $^

all: $(addprefix uml/, $(png)) main.pdf

clean:
	rm -f *.toc *.aux *.log *.out

view:
	open main.pdf

.PHONY: all clean view
```

The `.pu` files are source code of the UML diagrams, which are compiled into `.png` pictures. Vector graphic formats like EPS and PDF are also supported. Besides, [`.dot` files of Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) could be used for diagrams other than UML.
